          <p>So, as a kid I loved to keep track of the latest hardware and software on phones. This inspired me to find an api that holds all the specs and display it on the page. First, you need sign up and then login using <b><i>Express</i></b> server with <b><i>Node.JS</i></b> for the application's backend and <b><i>Postgres</i></b> for as DBMS.  Then with the <b><i>React</i></b> the user has two inputs that holds texts and I take the value of the input and attach it to the api.  After you click search, the reseult of the fetch gets added to a state using <b><i>Hooks</i></b> to display the name of the phones relevent to the search.  With a picture displayed you click the right phone that you want and it displays a table with all the specs.

              I built this Cryptocurrency exchange simulator with a friend for a bootcamp hackathon at Developers Institute.
              We made a simple databsae with a few tables to store user information, login information, currency rates, and transactions.
              We used <b><i>Node.JS</i></b> for the application's backend and <b><i>Postgres</i></b> for as DBMS.
              At the home page, our website gives the user a choice between logging in or signing up.
              If the user chooses to create a new account, all the information entered gets saved in the user table in our database. By default we give each user 0.2 Bitcoin upon signup.
              If the user decides to log in with existing credentials, the entered information gets saved in the login table in our database as well as a unique login id and whether the login was successful.
              Once the user is logged in, they have the option to exchange between the differnt currencies we offer! So far we only offer Bitcoin, Etherium, and USDC, but hey... we're still new to this game, so please understand.

              <h3>Card Game War</h3>
              <small><a href="https://github.com/dyschaf/Hackathon" target="_blank">GitHub</a></small>
              <p>
                This was one of my first real projects writen in <b><i>JavaScript</i></b>.  I used an object to holds my cards. This object also stored the value of each card and img background path.  The first thing that runs is the shuffle that each object to a random order, then splits the deck for player one and player two. On the page you can either click player one's button or player two's button and it causes the screen to show the first card of each player.  Whoever wins gets both players object index 0 wich would be push back of the deck. When there was a tie, I built into the DOM a container holding "war container" it displayed the top of the five card and the bottom of the 5 cards the each player.   Fifth was flip over and the bottom of the 5 was also fliped over. Then I set a set interval to wait three seconds to see which card the winner won and then pushes the cards to the winning player.

              <h3>ToDo List</h3>
              <small><a href="https://github.com/dyschaf/developers.institute/tree/main/week-6/day-5/ExerciseXP" target="_blank">GitHub</a></small>
              <p>
                This project is a classic ToDo list I used <b><i>JavaScript</i></b>.  I extracted a name, description, date, when it starts and when it ends with 4 inputs. This gets added to an array in <b><i>LocalStorage</i></b>.  I sorted each ToDo by starting date and then appended to a second HTML page.  If this ToDo is checked redefined as true "completed" and text turns green. If the end date passed the text would display red. I add a remover button to remove tasks from my <b><i>LocalStorage</i></b> and HTML page.
